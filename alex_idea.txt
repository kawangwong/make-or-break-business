Queue app - Will be a monolith where the apps share the same api. Alot of times different shopping apps and websites are being riddled with "bots" or malicious programs that imitate multiple active users trying to buy multiple high value products taking them out the hands of the real customers. But with my application will somewhat try to get the product in the actual customers hands. The reason for it to be be a monolith would be to allow for the app to move faster than that of one that is microserviced. Another reason is for cost-efficiency since we wont be using so many applications or services. Some examples of applications will be Customers, Companies, and Spot in Line.
