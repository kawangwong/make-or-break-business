<h1>Purpose</h1>

This reposotiory was created to allow collaboration between classmates in a group for the assignment of education ourselves and our classmates on
the differences between a microservice and a monolith service.

After this, our task was to come up with an application based on the principles described by our interpretation of what the services are and why we should choose
the microservice route or the monolithic route when designing the application.

Last, we are to document all that was done, describing exactly what was needed and how to do it in the terminal.
